Firstly, download the entire website code and extract the ZIP file to a folder on your local system.

## Step 2: Obtain the TMDB Movies API Key

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Get TMDB API Key 

- Go to https://www.themoviedb.org/ and log in.
- Click on your user profile picture in the navigation bar, and select "Settings".
- In the settings, select "API" and generate an API key.

## Step 3: Run the Website

Open your code editor (such as VS Code) and navigate to the project directory. Then, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the application. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the website.

Note: Ensure that you have carefully added the TMDB API key configuration to your .env file. If the .env file is not working, add all the API keys and configuration manually.
