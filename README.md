## Step 3: Run the Website

Open your code editor (such as VS Code) and navigate to the project directory. Then, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the application. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the website.

Note: Ensure that you have carefully added the TMDB API key configuration to your .env file. If the .env file is not working, add all the API keys and configuration manually.
